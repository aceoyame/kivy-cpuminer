# kivy-cpuminer
This is a GUI wrapper made with kivy for a qubit cpuminer. Rather than enter arguments on the command line, or create a batch file, the user can just open the program and fill the fields.

# How To Use
Just open the program, enter the number of threads to use, the mining pool (and port) you'd like to use, and your myriadcoin wallet address, and then press start mining. The miner should stop if you press stop mining or if you exit the program (if it crashes you may need to ctrl-alt-del and kill the miner process using task manager, but I don't think this should occur). Be aware that this is alpha quality software, so the paranthetical in the previous sentence may not be accurate.
